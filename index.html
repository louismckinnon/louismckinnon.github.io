        <h1>Louis McKinnon</h1>
        <p>Louis McKinnon is a prospective physician-economist who specializes in bringing together large-scale clinical initiatives with econometric techniques to pioneer effective and equitable advancements at the frontier of healthcare technology.</p>
        <p> Louis’ recent projects aim to advance telehealth and to understand the internet as a rising social determinant of health by promoting telehealth awareness, providing digital support to local communities, and analyzing the interaction between telehealth and internet access. With Roots Community Health, Louis has spent the past three years raising awareness and providing enrollment support for the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) among those impacted by systemic inequities and poverty in Oakland, CA. In conjunction, Louis has analyzed the extent to which internet serves as a “super” determinant of health among clinic patients and how the internet may underlie traditional determinants recognized by the American Medical Association (AMA).  </p>
        <p> Since January 2023, Louis has worked with Professors Amanda Kowalski, David Chan, and a team of interdisciplinary scholars across the University of Michigan and Michigan Medicine to analyze the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines using electronic health record (EHR) data and other rich individual level data on social determinants. While working as a research assistant, Louis currently also leads the development of a new telehealth initiative in collaboration with local community organizations in Ypsilanti, MI and with researchers associated with Michigan Medicine.  </p>
        <p> Prior to his work at the University of Michigan, Louis graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with BA in Economics and BA in English Literature in December 2022. From May 2023 to December 2023, Louis held a part-time position with the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (CHeSS) at the University of Chicago.  At CHeSS, Louis worked with Senior Methods Core Researchers and physician-economist Dr. David Melzter, who inspired his current aspirations, to improve operations on the hospitalist project and to curate datasets for other CHeSS affiliates. Prior to his work with CHeSS, Louis worked part-time with the Center for Translational Data Science (CTDS) also at the University of Chicago developing tools to analyze genomic expression from September 2021 to January 2022. He has also worked with Kaiser Permanente as a clinical research data analyst in the Department of Otolaryngology analyzing patterns behind drug-induced olfactory and gustatory adverse events. Louis also served as an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) with Berkeley Medical Reserve Corps (BMRC) and as an outreach volunteer with the Berkeley Needle Exchange Emergency Distribution (NEED) during his time at Berkeley. As an international student from Japan and Australia, Louis has also contributed to published work as a visiting researcher with Hiroshima Institute of Health Economics Research (HiHER) at Hiroshima University. </p>
