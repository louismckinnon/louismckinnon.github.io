            <p> I am a prospective physician-economist who specializes in bringing together large-scale clinical initiatives with econometric techniques to pioneer effective and equitable advancements at the frontier of healthcare technology. I seek to understand how we can ensure new medical resources are implemented and used in a way that is most effective for clinicians and best helps patients, especially where treatment options are limited and the potential for improvement is greatest. I am particulary interested in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias. </p>
            <p> My recent projects aim to advance telehealth equity and understand internet access as a rising social determinant of health. With Roots Community Health Center, I have spent the past three years raising awareness and providing enrollment support for the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) among those impacted by systemic inequities in Oakland, CA. In conjunction, I have analyzed the extent to which internet serves as a “super” determinant of health among clinic patients and how the internet may underlie traditional determinants recognized by the American Medical Association (AMA).  </p>
            <p> Since January 2023, I have worked with Professors Amanda Kowalski, David Chan, and a team of interdisciplinary scholars across the University of Michigan and Michigan Medicine to analyze the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines using electronic health record (EHR) data and other rich individual level data on social determinants. I also currently lead the development of a new clinical initiative, the Washtenaw Clinic Community Collaboration (WC3), in collaboration with Lori's Hands, other local community organizations in Washtenaw, MI, and with Michigan Medicine.  </p>
            <p> Prior to my work at the University of Michigan, I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with BA in Economics and BA in English Literature in December 2022. From May 2023 to December 2023, I held a part-time position with the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (CHeSS) at the University of Chicago.  At CHeSS, I worked with Senior Methods Core Researchers and physician-economist Dr. David Melzter to improve operations on the hospitalist project and to curate datasets for other CHeSS affiliates. I also served as an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) with Berkeley Medical Reserve Corps (BMRC) and as an outreach volunteer with the Berkeley Needle Exchange Emergency Distribution (NEED). As an international student from Japan and Australia, I have also contributed to published work as a visiting researcher with Hiroshima Institute of Health Economics Research (HiHER) at Hiroshima University. </p>
